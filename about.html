      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Story</h2>
      <p>We met at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School in Ellendale, North Dakota, where we were both pursuing degrees in Global Missions and Elementary Education, along with Biblical Studies. What started as a friendship built on shared chapel worship teams and late-night conversations about God's heart for the nations turned into something neither of us expected... a partnership for life and ministry.
      <p>We got married in May 2025, and honestly, we're still pinching ourselves. God has woven our stories together in ways that only He could have orchestrated. Hanna came to Trinity through the Pack Your Bags program in Fall 2022, traveling to the Philippines, Thailand, and Israel, serving on Native American reservations, and experiencing urban poverty firsthand in Milwaukee. Noah followed a year later in Fall 2023, with his Pack Your Bags journey taking him through similar stateside missions before traveling overseas to the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, and Greece.</p>
      <p>Those experiences didn't just shape our ministry philosophy, they changed us. We learned that missions isn't just about what we do; it's about who God is shaping us to become. And we're learning that together, one step of obedience at a time.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Calling</h2>
      <p>God has been pursuing our hearts for intercultural missions since we were young. Noah was in 7th grade when God gave him a vivid calling to South Sudan;a country he'd never been to, a people he didn't yet know, but a burden he couldn't shake. That calling has only deepened over the years, even through closed doors and postponed plans.</p>
      <p>Hanna's heart has always burned for the vulnerable and exploited. Through her studies and ministry experiences, God ignited in her a passion to see freedom come to those trapped in modern-day slavery and exploitation. She believes that every person, no matter their past, deserves to know they are seen, valued, and loved by God.</p>
      <p>Though our specific callings look different, they intersect beautifully. Refugees and the exploited often walk similar paths of trauma, displacement, and survival. We've come to see that God isn't calling us to separate missions, but to a shared vision: bringing hope, dignity, and the gospel to those society overlooks.</p>
      <p>We found our callings through prayer, mentorship, and hands-on mission work. From high ropes courses that taught us to trust God and each other, to serving in inner cities and overseas, to worshiping on chapel teams, God has used every season to prepare us. And we know He's not done yet.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Vision</h2>
      <p><em>"Here I am. Send me!"</em> (Isaiah 6:8)</p>
      <p>This is more than a verse to us. It's the heartbeat of our lives. We believe that God is constantly moving, constantly calling, constantly pursuing the lost and the broken. And if He's moving, we want to move with Him.</p>
      <p>Romans 10:14-15 asks the question that drives us: <em>"How can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent?"</em> The answer is simple; someone has to go. And by God's grace, we're saying yes.</p>
      <p>Our vision isn't complicated: we want to go where God sends us, love the people He loves, and proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ with our words and our lives. Whether that's in South Sudan, Las Vegas, or anywhere in between, we believe God is making all things new, and we want to be part of that story.</p>
      <p>One of Noah's biggest inspirations has been the song "So Will I (100 Billion X)" by Hillsong United. The idea that if God spoke galaxies into existence, painted sunsets, and breathed life into dust,and He still chooses to pursue us, then how could we not respond? <em>If the wind goes where you send it, so will I.</em> That's the song we're living.</p>
      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Life & Preparation</h2>
      <p>Right now, we're students at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School, set to graduate in Spring 2027. Noah is majoring in Global Missions, Hanna in Elementary Education, and we'll both graduate with degrees in Biblical Studies as well. We're soaking up every classroom lesson, chapel service, and mentorship opportunity we can, knowing that preparation matters.</p>
      <p>But honestly, some of our best preparation has happened outside the classroom. We're both actively involved in worship ministry; leading on chapel teams, student-led ministry teams at Trinity, and in nearby communities and churches. Worship has taught us that missions isn't just about what we do when we get there; it's about living with hearts surrendered to God every single day.</p>
      <p>Our time in the Pack Your Bags program was transformative. That year gave us full-time college credits while immersing us in real missions experiences. From team-building at high ropes courses to serving on Native American reservations, engaging in urban ministry in Chicago and Milwaukee, and spending five weeks overseas followed by tours through places like Israel, Turkey, and Greece. Those experiences taught us to stretch, to trust, and to embrace the unexpected. They taught us that God's timing is perfect, even when it doesn't match ours.</p>
      <p>We're learning to hold our plans with open hands. South Sudan remains our long-term calling, but God has shown us that His timeline is wiser than ours. So in the meantime, we're saying yes to every opportunity He opens, like our upcoming mission to Las Vegas with Operation for Freedom, working to liberate people stuck in slavery and exploitation.</p>
      <p>We're committed to being faithful wherever He places us, trusting that He's preparing us for everything that's ahead. We can't wait to see what He does next.</p>
