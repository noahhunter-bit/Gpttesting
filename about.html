      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Story</h2>
      <p>We met at Trinity Bible College and Graduate School. Both of us were pursuing Godâ€™s calling and had been individually following the direction of the Lord for years before we even met each other. We quickly realized that our callings to the mission field aligned in a beautiful way. Hanna has had a heart for people and ministry from a young age and has served in church and ministry roles for years. Noah has felt called to the mission field ever since God spoke to him about South Sudan when he was in middle school.</p>

      <p>After a season of prayer, discipleship, and growth, we got married in May 2025! God has continued to confirm His call on our lives and give us opportunities to serve Him both at home and abroad. Our marriage is a partnership that aims to bring the love of Christ to the nations and to the people He places in front of us every day.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Calling</h2>
      <p>Noah was in 7th grade when God gave him a vivid calling to South Sudan. Through prayer and confirmation, God made it clear that this would one day be a place where He would send Noah. Over the years, God has expanded that calling to include Hanna as well. Together, we feel burdened to reach the unreached and equip believers to take the Gospel where it has not yet been proclaimed.</p>

      <p>In this current season, we are preparing and training to be long-term missionaries. That includes finishing our education, connecting with mentors, serving in short-term missions, and continuing to build a foundation of prayer and support. Every trip we take and every conversation we have is another step toward the field God is preparing for us.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:'Merriweather',serif;color:var(--olive)">Our Vision</h2>
      <p><em>"Here I am. Send me!"</em> (Isaiah 6:8) â€” This verse captures our heart. We want to live fully surrendered to Christ, willing to go wherever He calls. Our vision is to make disciples, teach the Word, and see communities transformed by the love and truth of Jesus. Whether thatâ€™s in a remote village, a large city, or across the street, our goal is the same â€” to know Him and to make Him known.</p>
